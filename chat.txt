Hey, how was your weekend?
It was good, thanks for asking. I went on a hiking trip with some friends. How about you?
Sounds fun! I just had a relaxing weekend at home. Did you have good weather for the hike?
Yeah, it was a beautiful day. We had clear skies and a nice breeze.
That's great to hear. I need to get out and do some hiking myself soon.
You should! It's a great way to get some exercise and enjoy nature.
Definitely. So, have you heard about the new restaurant that just opened up downtown?
No, I haven't. What type of food do they serve?
It's a Thai restaurant. I heard their Pad Thai is amazing.
That sounds delicious. We should go check it out sometime.
I'm down for that. How about this weekend?
Saturday works for me. What time should we meet up?
How about 6 pm?
Sounds good to me. I'll see you then.
Hey, speaking of food, have you ever tried Ethiopian cuisine?
No, I haven't. What's it like?
It's really flavorful and unique. You eat with your hands and the dishes are served on a large plate with injera bread.
That sounds interesting. Do you have any recommendations for a good Ethiopian restaurant?
Yeah, there's a great one called Blue Nile. We should go there sometime.
I'm definitely up for trying something new. When should we go?
How about next weekend?
Sounds good to me. What day works for you?
Sunday works for me. How about you?
Sunday works for me too. What time should we meet up?
How about 5 pm?
Sounds good to me. I'll see you then.
Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
Yeah, I just saw a really good indie film called "Moonlight". It's a coming-of-age story about a young black man growing up in Miami.
That sounds really interesting. Is it still in theaters?
No, I think it's out on DVD now. You should definitely check it out.
I will. Thanks for the recommendation!
No problem. Let me know what you think of it.
